 complete your final course project, which brings together concepts and practices you previously learned in the first three modules. In this final project, you will design and load data into a data warehouse using facts and dimension tables. Then you’ll write aggregation queries using CUBE and ROLLUP functions and create materialized query tables, known as a materialized view. You will complete your project by using IBM Cognos to create an analytics dashboard.
